# ATM-SYSTEM-USING-VERILOG-
ATM-System-using-verilog
The objective of this project is to carry out ASIC design and verification for an ATM-based banking system. The project assumes that auxiliary devices, such as card handling, money counting, and timers, are already available. Moreover, it is assumed that account information, such as passwords, account numbers, and balances, is stored locally and does not require a database connection. The project group will be split into two teams: the Design Team and the Verification Team. The Design Team will be accountable for system architecture, high-level modeling, creating a reference model, and writing Verilog code. The Verification Team will create a testbench that encompasses test stimulus using various directed and constraint random testing, self-checking TB using reference models, define design properties or assertions using PSL, enable code coverage, and create coverage reports for statement, branch, and FSM coverage.
